I am a doctoral candidate in Health Policy and Management at Harvard Business School, advised by Rob Huckman.

## Research

My research examines **how expert knowledge shapes organizations**—particularly the tension between physicians' professional autonomy and managerial oversight. I pursue two interrelated research streams:

**Utilization Management and Value-Based Care**: How do insurance companies, value-based payment programs, and hospital managers influence physicians? What are the effects on patient care? I study Medicare Advantage and ACO programs, prior authorization and claim denials, and advanced primary care practices.

**Provider Specialization**: How do doctors become experts? How do hospital teams learn to perform new procedures? I study physician training, professionalism, and technology diffusion.

## Background

Before graduate school, I was a research assistant at Harvard Medical School (with Bruce Landon and Michael McWilliams) and a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, where I focused on healthcare strategy and policy. I remain available for consulting engagements.
