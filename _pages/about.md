I am a doctoral candidate in Health Policy and Management at Harvard Business School, advised by Rob Huckman.

## Research

I like thinking about the evolving role of physicians as professionals. Even as medicine becomes more complex and physicians' expertise more specialized, their decisions are more constrained than ever by non-professional organizations like health systems and insurance companies.

My research is mostly set in the Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs. I use data from medical claims, electronic health records, and operational data from third-party organizations.

**Utilization Management and Value-Based Care**: How do insurance companies, value-based payment programs, and health system managers influence physicians? What are the effects on patient care? I study Medicare Advantage and ACO programs, prior authorization and claim denials, and advanced primary care practices.

**Provider Specialization**: How do doctors become experts? How do hospital teams learn to perform new procedures? I study physician training, specialization, and technology diffusion.

## Background

Before graduate school, I was a research assistant at Harvard Medical School (with Bruce Landon and Michael McWilliams) and a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, where I focused on healthcare strategy and policy. I remain available for consulting engagements.
