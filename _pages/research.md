My research examines how expert knowledge shapes organizations, with a focus on health care. I am particularly interested in the tension between physicians' professional autonomy and the traditional prerogatives of managers and payers.

## Utilization Management and Value-Based Care

How do insurance companies, value-based payment programs, and hospital managers influence physicians? What are the effects on patient care? I study Medicare Advantage and ACO programs, prior authorization and claim denials, and advanced primary care practices.

## Provider Specialization

How do doctors become experts? How do hospital teams learn to perform new procedures? I study physician training, professionalism, and technology diffusion.
